# Sms_Spam_Classification
SMS Spam Detection is a machine learning–based system designed to automatically classify text messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham). The goal of this project is to help filter unwanted, fraudulent, or promotional messages while allowing legitimate messages to reach users.

The system works by preprocessing raw SMS text and extracting meaningful features using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization (e.g., Bag of Words or TF-IDF). These features are then fed into a trained classification model that learns patterns commonly found in spam messages.
